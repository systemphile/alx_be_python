#Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations with two predefined numbers

number1 ,number2 = 10, 5 #Assign specific values
sum = number1 + number2 #Find the sum of the numbers
difference = number1 - number2 #Find the difference of the numbers
product = number1 * number2 #Find the product of the numbers

#Print results of each operation
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum} \nSubtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference} \nMultiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product}")
